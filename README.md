YouTube Watch History Analysis (Portfolio Project)

This project is part of my data analytics portfolio — a personal analysis of my **YouTube watch history** using Python. 
The goal was to explore patterns in my viewing behavior, practice exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate insights from everyday data.

📁Data Source
- Exported using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
- File used: `watch-history.html`

🧰Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

📊What I Did
1. Parsed the HTML file and extracted relevant data
2. Cleaned and formatted timestamps
3. Created new features like Year, Month, Hour, and Weekday
4. Visualized viewing behavior over time

🔍Key Insights
- **Most Watched Channel:** *Nursery Rhymes and Kids Songs* (watched with my niece & nephew)
- **Peak Viewing Year:** *2025*, driven by data analytics content
- **Peak Hour:** *9:00 AM* (I'm a morning person)
- **Most Active Day:** *Saturday*

💡Why This Matters
- Real-world data cleaning & wrangling practice
- A creative, personalized portfolio project
- Strengthened my storytelling skills through data
